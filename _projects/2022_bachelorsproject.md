**Abstract:**
\\(F_{pl}\\), as Galois groups. The first half of the project focuses on realising the general case. At the end of this first half, a class of examples for the case \\(l=\frac{p-1}{2}\\) is constructed. In the proof of the general case, we have to make a certain assumption. Hence, we will, in the second half, consider a special case, where we can confirm that the assumption holds. This special case is for \\(l=2\\), i.e., \\(F_{2p}=D_p\\). The main theorem of this second half is that given a quadratic extension, \\(D_p\\) can be realised in infinitely many different ways. To do this we will need to introduce notions from class field theory. Amongst other things, we will need a formula for the class number, which will be introduced and proven.
