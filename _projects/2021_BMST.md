I was part of the first edition of BMST, which brought together students from 6 EU universities. I worked together with two other students (Jadwiga from Poland and Antonio from Italy) under the supervision of Michael Winckler at Heidelberg University. Our project was about numerical methods. The conclusion of the project was a meeting in Heidelberg, where we presented our work to each other - including the wiki-pages that we wrote as part of the project (in both English and each of our native languages).
