The Mathematical Student Council is happy to announce that we will have a student lecture Friday the 17th of February, held by Marie Stuhr Kaltoft.

Abstract: I will begin with a short introduction to Galois theory. I will then get in to inverse Galois theory, where I will give some examples and state a nice proposition about dihedral groups. At the end I will sketch a theorem for the case of Frobenius groups.

Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of group theory (Algebra 1)

Place: AUD 10
